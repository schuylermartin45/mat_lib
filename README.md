# Stack-based Matrix Library

This is a stack-space-based matrix library I started to write while waiting
for my car to get serviced once. Their wifi was busted and I had my laptop so
this is what I decided to do.

Not sure if I'll get back to this, but I think it could be kind of a cool
and quick project to build out. I'm trying to build this library without using
any external dependencies (i.e. no malloc/dynamic memory allocation).
